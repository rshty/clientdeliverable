Client Project Deliverable - SI 339

To run the editing.py python script, just enter python3 editing.py in the terminal. Make sure you are in the client deliverable folder before running the editing.py file. 

How editing.py works:

editing.py scans 3 csv files and reads in the meet name, meet date, and meet comments. It then sets these variables in the HTML code and writes this HTML code to the appropriate HTML files.
